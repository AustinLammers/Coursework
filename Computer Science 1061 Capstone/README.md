This folder contains my final project for CSC 1061 Computer Science I: (C++). I completed this course through Front Range Community College during my senior year at Loveland High School (2022-2023).
The project itself is a text-based adventure game demonstrating my understanding of exception handling, data structures, classes, and other high-level components of the C++ language.
