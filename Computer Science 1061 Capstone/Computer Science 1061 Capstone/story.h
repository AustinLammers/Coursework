std::string levels[20] = {R"(Your eyes snap open to be greeted by the stone walls of a prison cell. Beyond the barred door, a guard stands, keys in hand. He says, "Oi! You're free to go!" Confused, you quickly gather what little belongings you have.

+ 1 Leather Shoes
+ 1 Broken Pocket Watch

The guard unlocks the door with a metallic *clunk* as the locking lug disengages allowing the door to screech its way open. The guard gestures for you to leave the cell and you begin your way out of the prison. While you walk the guard explains a gentleman by the name of Sir Raspian has paid for your release. At the mention of the name, the hairs on the back of your long unshaven neck stand up. Sir Raspian, the leader of a large bandit clan, had bought you from the jail, as if you were some sort of commodity. Angered by this realization, you reach the front gates. Two mysterious (and large) looking men stand next to a carriage waiting, presumably for you. Time to make a choice: Go with them, or try to escape.

1. Hop in the Carriage
2. RUN!
3. Put them in the infirmary!
4. Play Dead
)",

R"(You have chosen to go peacefully with the men, hopping up into the carriage. The men sit on either side of you, borderline crushing you flat. You could not move even if you wanted to though you probably don't because the men could likely overpower you before you even threw a punch.

1. Punch them anyway! 
2. Remain in your meat seatbelt
3. Wait Patiently
4. Twiddle your thumbs

)"
,
R"(You start running, and I mean running. Who knew you could move so quickly! The massive men pursuing you are less impressive. Their sheer size seems to get in the way of their ability to run faster than a brisk walk. Needless to say, you get away, blending in with the cross of a nearby village. Where will you go now?

1. The Tavern
2. The General Store
3. Accomplices house
4. Leave the town
)"
,
R"(You charge one of them. He simply sticks his hand out and your forehead collides with it. You are now left swinging at this man as if you are a four year old trying to fight your older brother. You eventually tire out and the men put you in the carriage.

1. Continue
2. Continue
3. Continue
4. Continue
)"
,
R"(Seriously! What was the plan there! You thought you could just flop on the ground and they would leave after a while! You're not a fly, people don't just die like a timer expired. The men laugh at your failed attempt at deception and decide to turn your acting into reality (Select 0-4)
)"
,
R"(You went down quicker than expected. You inhaled a bit too loud to prepare your scrawny body to throw an overly ambitious punch and the man on your right gave you a broken nose. No literally, he handed you a clay sculpture of a broken nose. You understand the message and decide to pipe down a bit.

+1 Broken Nose

You sit patiently awaiting your arrival to wherever it is you are going

1. Continue
2. Continue
3. Continue
4. Continue

)"
,
R"(It's probably for the best. The carriage continues up a rocky, winding road to a darkly colored mansion. This was surely the residence of Sir Raspian. The carriage comes to a stop outside of the massive building. The guards remove you from the carriage and escort you inside to the office of a tall, skinny man in a suit. The man says: you seem to have a very unique set of skills that could be of use to me. You see, I have an issue with a certain group of bandits living in town and, seeing as you owe your freedom to me, it is your job to take care of them. 

What'll it be? Do you accept the job offer or not?

1. HECK YEAH! 
2. HECK NO!
3. I'll have to think about it
4. RUN!!
)"
,
R"(Sir Raspian seems pleased. He hands you a map with a large X on it. It marks both the spot but also nearby town. You set off on your way, formulating a plan of attack along the way. The bandits are known to shoot on sight so it is imperative you have a good plan.

1. Run in guns blazin!
2. Go in sneaky like
3. Disguise yourself and walk through the front door
4. Figure it out later (Procrastination 1000)

)"
,
R"(This does not please Sir Raspian. He becomes audibly upset. He starts huffing and puffing like a 12 year old. Dang it! He says. Have a nice day then I guess. Really, it was that easy? You walk out of the mansion almost wanting more. Part of you wishes that there had been more theater involved in the whole event. Anyway, you end up getting a cottage in the country, far away from the likes of anybody who could persecute you. THE END.

)"
,
R"(The man responds to your hesitation: What is there to think about? You do the job I let you go. You don't, you maybe die, you maybe get sent back to jail. I'm sure you will make the right choice.

1. HECK YEAH! 
2. HECK NO!
3. I'll have to think about it
4. RUN!!

)"
,
R"(You're sure he must have the wrong guy. In an impressive show of athletic incapability you leap from your chair, ducking under the arms of the guards and running through the massive doors of the office. Running through the corridors you try to remember your way out but you were admiring the artwork and architecture on the way in so you are not 100 percent sure where to go. You come across a 4 way corridor. Should you go left, right or forward?

1. Left
2. Right
3. Forward
4. Turn Around

)"
,
R"(You picked wrong. You walked straight into two guards taking a smoke break next to an elevator. They immediately recognise you and bring you to the ground. You wake up, in the cellar of the mansion, all sorts of torture devices surround you. You notice your hands and legs have been tied up and you begin to slowly stretch. The stretching gives you the most euphoric chiropractic treatment of your life but it quickly becomes painful. So painful, that you black out, never to awake again.

)"
,
R"(You draw your trusty 6 shot revolver, taking out 3 adversaries in one burst. You hastily reload your weapon before jumping out of cover, firing all six shots into the general area of your enemies missing every single shot. Quite the contrast from your first 3. You get clipped in the shoulder by a bullet forcing you back to back into cover. This wound was among the most painful you had ever felt. While tending to your wound you did not hear the men sneaking up behind you. They were able to capture you and send you to the cellar where you would spend the rest of your days.

)"
,
R"(You arrive at the back door of the bandit complex. Removing your shoes, you walk in. In a half crouched stance, you walk behind several guard outposts unnoticed. The plan was working. You followed the signs that lead you directly toward the chief's office. One of the last things Sir Raspian had told you before leaving was that there was a long hallway leading to the door with two guards stationed outside. You would not be able to walk up the hallway. Instead, you climb to the rafters and walk across them to the office door. Taking out your poison dart gun, you dart both the guards and drop down. Finally, you open the doors to be greeted by the chief himself. You quickly dart him as he tries to draw his weapon. This act of great skill impressed the bandits so much, they elected you to replace their leader. You would spend the rest of your life leading the bandits.

)"
,
R"(You take out one of the patrolling guards and put on his clothes. Walking through the front door, you give the typical bandit greeting you had observed some of them doing and continue walking briskly but confidently. One guard notices your nametag and tries to talk with you. Evidently, the guy you killed had friends. When you couldn't answer the man's questions about your own (well the other guy's) children he became suspicious and reported you. You were held in a cell for 30 days before being executed. 

)"
,
R"(Oh, so you're one of those types. Well, you thoroughly enjoy your walk to the base, completely unburdened by having a plan. You continue walking, enjoying your time when you find yourself in the front lobby with several guns in your face. You accept your fate and await your execution.

)"
,
R"(You decide to head to the tavern to get drunk out of your mind. You down 11 glasses of grog before getting into a fight with a man Bergsonian who lands you in the hospital with a coma you will never recover from.


)"
,
R"(What could go wrong at the general store. You decide you are going to buy some snacks and go watch the sunset. This would have been a lovely idea if you weren't actively on the run from two of Sir Raspian's men. Needless to say, you won't be seeing that sunset or walking for a little while.


)"
,
R"(You decide to lay low at a friend's house. Probably the right move. Well it would have been if your friend wasn't also a criminal who robbed you blind in your sleep. Now, being blind you wander into the street in confusion and terror to get run over by a carriage.
)"
,
R"(You decide the right call is to turn around and leave town. Not my personal favorite choice but it's your story. You walk about 6 feet from the side of the trail in an attempt to avoid the men who were chasing you but this measure didn't exactly work. The men spotted you and beat you to a pulp.
